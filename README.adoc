This is a very work-in-progress mod for integrating OWO Suit haptics into Resonite.

Its development is flaky out of health concerns; my right arm wouldn't stop spazzing after continuous very low intensity shocks (4 on arms, 10 on other parts, to simulate a hug) for around a minute. Likely a fluke.

If you want to help out, you can use the https://owo-game.gitbook.io/c/tools/owo-visualizer[OWO Visualizer] to develop without using an OWO Suit.
